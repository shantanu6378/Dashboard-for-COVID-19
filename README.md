# Dashboard-for-COVID-19

The first step to solve a problem is to understand it. And an efficient way to understand a problem is using visual representation of its aspects. This project deals with the visual representation of data regarding COVID-19 in the different states and counties. I have build an interactive web tool using Dash to view the different features. The following features have been presented:

1. US map showing the percentage of vaccinated population (partially and fully) in different states.

2. Map of different states with the percentage of vaccinated (partially and fully) in different counties.

3. A time-series plot of 7-day moving average of percent COVID-19 positivity rate for different counties on different selected date ranges.

4. A time-series plot 7-day moving average of new COVID-19 cases per 100K for different counties on different selected date ranges.
